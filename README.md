# Kafka Healthcheck

Checks the health of a Kafka Cluster by sending a roundtrip
message. This tool can be used as a normal CLI script that returns
when the roundtrip was successful or it can start a webserver that
tests a roundtrip on each request.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g kafka-healthcheck
```

export KAFKA_URL=localhost:9092
export HEALTHCHECK_TOPIC=healthcheck
export REPLICATION_FACTOR=1
export DEBUG="wait-for-kafka*|kafka-healthcheck*"
unset HTTP_PORT
kafka-healthcheck
```

### As a server

```sh
export KAFKA_URL=localhost:9092
export HEALTHCHECK_TOPIC=healthcheck
export REPLICATION_FACTOR=1
export DEBUG="wait-for-kafka*|kafka-healthcheck*"
export HTTP_PORT=8080
kafka-healthcheck
```
